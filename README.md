# In most case we do image classification but some specific cases are required whole video classification
## Mostly for madical data

### In this work I used the data provided by hasibzunair which are MRI data.
### Videoes are mainly a array of lots of frames or images.
### And frames or images are representable into 2(gray-scale) or  2/3(RGB) dimansional array.
### So techniqully we can say videoes are nothing but 3 dimensional array where the 3rd dimension is the time.
